* Example: Vending Machine System Design

Include a combinational /datapath/ unit, which is a stateful circuit that stores
the current amount of money entered.

The HLSM consists of the following states:
- Initialize
- Wait
- Add
- Dispense
  
State transition table:

$Q_1^+ Q_0^+$
| $Q_1 Q_0 \downarrow$, $C tot\_lt\_s \rightarrow$ | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |
|                                               00 | 01 | 01 | 01 | 01 |
|                                               01 | 11 | 01 | 10 | 10 |
|                                               11 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 |
|                                               10 | 01 | 01 | 01 | 01 |

Controller outputs:
\begin{align*}
tot\_ld &= Q_1 \overline{Q_0} \\
d &= Q_1 Q_0 \\
tot\_clr &= \overline{Q_1} \;\overline{Q_0}
\end{align*}

Next-state equations:
\begin{align*}
Q_1^+ &= C \overline{Q_1} Q_0 + \overline{tot\_lt\_s} \;\overline{Q_1} Q_0 \\
Q_0^+ &= \overline{Q_0} + \overline{C}\;\overline{Q_1}
\end{align*}

The biggest difference between an HLSM and a FSM is that we deal with
higher-level /states/ and focus on transitioning between states, not on raw
binary values.
* Asynchronous Design

This is a non-clocked circuit that uses /latches/ to store output instead of 
clocked flip-flops.

Problems with latches:
- Race conditions
- Cycles
* State Reduction

Steps:
1. Construct a triangular chart which contains a rectangular box for each pair
   of states.
2. Compare each pair of rows in the state table. If the outputs associated with
   state $i$ and state $j$ are different, place an /X/ in square $(i, j)$ to
   indicate that $i \ne j$.
3. If the outputs are the same (empty boxes), then place an implied pair in
   square $(i, j)$. 
   
** Example:

| Present State | X = 0 | X = 1 | Output Z |
|---------------+-------+-------+----------|
| a             | d     | c     |        0 |
| b             | f     | h     |        0 |
| c             | e     | d     |        1 |
| d             | a     | e     |        0 |
| e             | c     | a     |        1 |
| f             | f     | b     |        1 |
| g             | b     | h     |        0 |
| h             | c     | g     |        1 |

We can see here that $a = d$ and $c = e$. The reduced state table:
| Present State | X = 0 | X = 1 | Output Z |
|---------------+-------+-------+----------|
| a             | a     | c     |        0 |
| b             | f     | h     |        0 |
| c             | c     | a     |        1 |
| f             | f     | b     |        1 |
| g             | b     | h     |        0 |
| h             | c     | g     |        1 |
