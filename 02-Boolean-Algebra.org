* Definitions
  
/Disjunction/, or logical OR, will be represented as $+$. /Conjunction/, or 
logical AND, will be represented as $\cdot$.
  
Assume there are at least two distinct elements in the Boolean field $B$:
- Disjunction and conjunction are closed over $B$.
- Disjunction and conjunction are commutative.
- Disjunction and conjunction are associative.
- The identity for disjunction is 0 ($a + 0 = a$).
- The identity for conjunction is 1 ($a + 1 = a$).
- Distributive laws hold for disjunction and conjunction too.
- The /complement/ of $a$ is an element of $B$ that satisfies the
  following statements:
\begin{align*}
a + a' &= 1 \\
a \cdot a' &= 0
\end{align*}
- The /dual/ can be found by swapping AND and OR and swapping 0 and 1.
  - If both functions are equal, the expression is called /self-dual/.

* Huntington Postulates and Algebraic Laws
  
Throughout, AND + NOT = NAND, OR + NOT = NOR. Each of these two gates are
functionally complete.
  
Given an element $x \in B$, we can draw circuit switches to represent various laws:

- Two-switch identity gates :: a two-switch OR gate can be reduced to a
     single-switch AND gate.
- Idempotence Laws :: If two switches are coupled, they can be reduced to a
     single switch.
- Involution Laws :: If the NOT operation is applied twice in a row, the inverters
     can be eliminated.
- Complementarity Laws :: A complement can be reduced to a constant gate.
- Commutative Laws :: We can switch the direction of any two gates either ORed
     or ANDed to each other.
- Associative Laws :: Two back-to-back two-input gates can be reduced to a single
     three-input gate.
- DeMorgan's Laws :: AND \equiv NOR, OR \equiv NAND

* Basic Theorems
  
** Consensus Theorems
   
Goal: to minimize the number of required transistors.

Statement: 
\begin{align*}
X \cdot Y + Y \cdot Z + X' \cdot Z &= X \cdot Y + X' \cdot Z \\
(X + Y) \cdot (Y + Z) \cdot (X' + Z) &= (X + Y) \cdot (X' + Z)
\end{align*}

In a sense, the middle gate is unnecessary. Proof is provided in the course
pack.

* Proving Techniques
  
*NOTE:* Whenever writing proofs, write /all the steps/. This will make it much
easier to write programs from mathematical descriptions.

* The Carry Function for a Full Adder
  
This function is self-dual. 

$C_{out} = A \cdot B + B \cdot C_{in} + C_{in} \cdot A$

* Common Logic Gates

- AND :: Both inputs must be 1.
- OR :: Both inputs must not be 0.
- XOR :: Only one of the inputs must be 1.
- Inverter (NOT) :: Returns the opposite of the input.
- Buffer :: Returns the input.
- NAND :: NOT + AND
- NOR :: NOT + OR
- XNOR :: Tests for equivalence.
