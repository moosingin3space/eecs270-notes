* Random Logic Design
  
Easy to build low-area, low-power devices.

* Structured Logic
  
Programmable logic, such as PLA, PLD, PGA, and ROM.

In general, increased chip area, which results in higher power consumption.
  
* Combinational Building Blocks

** Decoder
   
A /decoder/ has $n$ input lines and at most $2^n$ unique outputs.  The inputs 
are called /address inputs/, and often decoders come with an $E$ input (for
enable). 

Truth table for 1:2 active-1 decoder:
| $E$ | $A_0$ | $D_0$ | $D_1$ |
|-----+-------+-------+-------|
|   0 |     X |     0 |     0 |
|   1 |     0 |     1 |     0 |
|   1 |     1 |     0 |     1 |

A 2:4 active-1 decoder looks like:
| $E$ | $A_0$ | $A_1$ | $D_0$ | $D_1$ | $D_2$ | $D_3$ |
|-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
|   0 | X     | X     |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |
|   1 | 0     | 0     |     1 |     0 |     0 |     0 |
|   1 | 0     | 1     |     0 |     1 |     0 |     0 |
|   1 | 1     | 0     |     0 |     0 |     1 |     0 |
|   1 | 1     | 1     |     0 |     0 |     0 |     1 |

** Multiplexer
   
Opposite of a decoder -- it converts more inputs to fewer outputs.

Easily implemented as $Z = \sum_{i=0}^n I_i (\prod_{j=0}^m S_j)$. 

** Demultiplexer

** Encoder

** Comparator
